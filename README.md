This is a classification project, since the variable to predict is binary (bankruptcy or non-bankruptcy). The goal here is to model the probability that a business goes bankrupt from different features.
The data file contains 7 features about 250 companies
The data set includes the following variables:
1.	industrial_risk: 0=low risk, 0.5=medium risk, 1=high risk.
2.	management_risk: 0=low risk, 0.5=medium risk, 1=high risk.
3.	financial flexibility: 0=low flexibility, 0.5=medium flexibility, 1=high flexibility.
4.	credibility: 0=low credibility, 0.5=medium credibility, 1=high credibility.
5.	competitiveness: 0=low competitiveness, 0.5=medium competitiveness, 1=high competitiveness.
6.	operating_risk: 0=low risk, 0.5=medium risk, 1=high risk.
7.	class: bankruptcy, non-bankruptcy (target variable).


Objective: To predict the likelihood of business bankruptcy using machine learning, helping businesses identify and mitigate financial risks.
Tool Used: Python with libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and seaborn for data analysis, modeling, and visualization.
Business Need: Businesses often face financial challenges that can lead to bankruptcy. By predicting bankruptcy risk, businesses can proactively manage their finances and make informed decisions to avoid financial distress.
Techniques Used: Data Collection,Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA),Data Preprocessing,Model Selection and Training,Model Evaluation,Model Deployment.
Conclusion: By accurately predicting bankruptcy risk, the business can proactively manage financial risks and make informed decisions to avoid bankruptcy.
